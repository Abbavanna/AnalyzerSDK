# Saleae Analyzer SDK Legacy Branch

This branch, “1.1.14-legacy”, contains the libraries and headers for an older version of the Analyzer SDK, used exclusively for debugging analyzers on Windows targets. Production analyzers should be built using the master branch of this repository. Debugging custom analyzers on MacOS or Linux operating systems should also be done using the master branch.

The latest Saleae software should not be used with analyzers built with this SDK. We recommend using the 32 bit Windows release of the 1.1.18 Logic Software specifically when debugging analyzers on Windows.
